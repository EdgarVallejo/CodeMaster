Create an interactive application that simulates a Java greenfield coding assessment similar to those used by Zillow on the CodeSignal platform. The application should provide a problem description, an interactive coding environment where the user can write Java code, and a mechanism to "submit" the code for evaluation.

Here are the specific requirements:

    Problem Generation: The application should generate (or provide a set of pre-defined) open-ended, real-world problem descriptions related to Zillow's domain (real estate data, search, etc.). These problems should be less algorithmic and more focused on designing and implementing a solution from scratch.
    Interactive Java Coding Environment: Provide a text editor or code area where users can write and edit Java code. Ideally, this should have basic syntax highlighting and error checking (if feasible).
    Submission Mechanism: Include a "Submit" button or similar functionality that triggers the evaluation of the user's code.
    Evaluation Logic: Upon submission, the application should simulate a basic evaluation. This could involve:
        Checking for compilation errors.
        Running the user's code against a few predefined test cases (with input and expected output).
        Providing feedback on whether the code passed the test cases.
        Ideally, give some basic feedback on the code quality, like "Good use of data structures" or "Consider adding more comments."
    Time Limit (Optional): For a more realistic simulation, consider adding a timer to the coding environment.
    Example Problem: Here's an example problem to start with: "Design a simple system to store and retrieve property listings. Each listing should have an address, price, and number of bedrooms. Implement methods to add a new listing and to find all listings within a given price range."

The goal is to create an application that gives users a feel for what a Java greenfield coding assessment on CodeSignal might be like, focusing on problem-solving, code design, and communication of their approach.
